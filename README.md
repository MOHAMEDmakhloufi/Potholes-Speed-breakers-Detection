# Potholes-Speed-breakers-Detection
project involves a comprehensive approach to detecting road anomalies like potholes and speed-breakers using accelerometer data, mapping their locations, predicting gear changes based on vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, and processing video to identify road abnormalities and human presence. Below is a detailed review of your code, addressing potential issues, offering solutions to warnings, and suggesting improvements for better performance and accuracy.
Problem
We'll explore the process of detecting road anomalies, such as potholes and speed-breakers, using data collected from vehicle sensors.

Overview of the Dataset
The data is collected through the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) system, a standardized system in vehicles that monitors and reports various performance and condition aspects. It enables communication between the vehicle and external devices, helping to identify and diagnose vehicle issues.

Plotting Acceleration Data
We plotted acceleration data over time, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing acceleration in the x, y, and z directions. In the plot, blue represents the x direction, red represents the y direction, and green represents the z direction.

Pothole Detection
Potholes are detected using the acceleration in the y direction. For instance, a 3D pothole with three axes shows that the y-axis values are negative, falling below zero. We detect potholes by identifying negative peaks in the y-axis acceleration data, using the peakutils library, which identified five such peaks, represented by red circles.

Speed-Breaker Detection
Similarly, we can detect speed-breakers by analyzing the acceleration in the y direction, but this time we focus on positive peaks. Applying the same peak detection technique, we identified seven positive peaks, indicating the presence of speed-breakers.

Conclusion
In summary, our approach allows us to detect speed-breakers through positive peaks in y-axis acceleration and potholes through negative peaks.
